/*1) What is  Dynamic programming ?
 --> Dynamic programming is a technique that breaks the problems into sub-problems, and saves the result for future purposes so that we do not need to compute the result again 
 --> Dp is tack bruteforce and it optimize it 

Some time some Qes Coding is problomatic  
becuse we redo stap again & again 
we need to avoid repeting think we done earlier 
like:-
 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1  = 6 
if we store sum and use agin in other opration than we get ans faster
